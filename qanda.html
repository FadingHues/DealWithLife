              For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide.
              A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor

            <p> Every year 703 000 people take their own life and there are many
            more people who attempt suicide. Every suicide is a tragedy that
            affects families, communities and entire countries and has
            long-lasting effects on the people left behind. Suicide occurs
            throughout the lifespan and was the fourth leading cause of death
            among 15-29 year-olds globally in 2019. </p> <br />

            <p> Suicide does not just occur in high-income countries, but is a
            global phenomenon in all regions of the world. In fact, over 77% of
            global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries in
            2019. </p> <br />

            <p> Suicide is a serious public health problem; however, suicides are
            preventable with timely, evidence-based and often low-cost
            interventions. For national responses to be effective, a
            comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed. </p> <br>
